Management Science paper accepted. 

Thrilled to announce that our research paper "Economics of Social Media Fake Accounts", co-authored with Dr. Zihong Huang, has been accepted for publication in Management Science! üìù‚ú® It is one of my favorite projects in recent years and has been long time in the making.

Our study delves into the complex ecosystem of fake social media accounts in the influencer economy. We investigate fake-account purchasing behaviors, the effectiveness of anti-fake measures, and their effects on social media platform profits and consumer welfare. Our findings reveal intriguing insights into how anti-fake efforts and measures may result in more fake accounts in the near term and why social media platforms favor minimal anti-fake efforts.

Key takeaways:

- Heightened efforts in detecting and removing fake accounts can sometimes result in an increase in fake accounts in equilibrium.
- Purely profit-driven social media platforms tend to favor minimal anti-fake efforts.
- Enhancing social media literacy and raising the costs of fake accounts benefit consumers, but they can negatively impact platform profits. 
- Both platforms and consumers stand to gain from advancements in anti-fake technology, which can enhance the accurate identification of fake accounts.
